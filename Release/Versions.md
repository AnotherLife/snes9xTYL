## Snes9xTYL Mod versions

- s9xTYLcm version is mean to be used on PSVita with Adrenaline, eCFW ARK, VHBL, etc. It works on PSP too but is slower than s9xTYLme version.
- s9xTYLme version is for all PSP models, It uses Media Engine for sound emulation and is faster than s9xTYLcm. It is not compatible with PSVita.
Before updating, make sure to backup your SAVES and/or S9XTYLSAVES folders just in case something goes wrong.

### Help and Tips

- Some games run faster if "Ignore Palette writes" and/or "Simple Palette writes" are enabled on MISC->Hack/debug menu.
- If you get a black screen at loading a game, you can try to disable "Speed hacks" on MISC->Hack/debug menu, and then load the game again.
