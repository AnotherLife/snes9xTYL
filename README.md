***Before updating, make sure to backup your SAVES and/or S9XTYLSAVES folders just in case something goes wrong.

### Help and Tips

- Some games run faster if "Ignore Palette writes" and/or "Simple Palette writes" are enabled on MISC->Hack/debug menu.
- If you get a black screen at loading a game, you can try to disable "Speed hacks" on MISC->Hack/debug menu, and then load the game again.

### Features

- Standby/sleep mode on "me" version.
- Netplay (multiplayer) suppport.
- Zipped ROM support.
- IPS patch file (have to be the same name as game with .IPS extension : SOE.ZIP => SOE.IPS)
- Compressed Savestate with small screenshot.
- Auto save of SRAM on game change, exit & Snes reset so you should never lose them ;-).
- Autoskip.
- Gamma correction.
- VSync support.

- Detailed Battery informations.
- 222, 266, 300 & 333Mhz PSP frequency.
- Snapshot based Icon per game. Take a snapshot while ingame (using GUI) & then you'll have it in file browser.

	- Mode0 : Optimized Snes9x

	- Mode2 : Hardware accelerated (using PSP's GU)

Yes you read well, this version support nearly all the graphics effects of the Snes accelerated with PSP hardware.
Except : offset mode & mode 7. Priority and blending are fully emulated.
For the moment a few graphic glitches remain, we did our best for the moment in our knowledge. Please understand.
